# Design Flows

This project is configured with the following AI design workflows:

## BMad

Bottom-up Methodology for AI-Driven Development - Build progressively from foundation

**Guide**: [bmad/GUIDE.md](./bmad/GUIDE.md)

**Template**: [bmad/TEMPLATE.md](./bmad/TEMPLATE.md)

## Spec Kits

Specification-driven design - Plan comprehensively before implementation

**Guide**: [spec-kits/GUIDE.md](./spec-kits/GUIDE.md)

**Template**: [spec-kits/TEMPLATE.md](./spec-kits/TEMPLATE.md)

## How to Use Design Flows

Each design flow includes:

1. **GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive methodology guide
   - Workflow phases
   - Best practices
   - Integration with project docs
   - Tips for working with AI

2. **TEMPLATE.md** - Practical working template
   - Phase tracking
   - Task checklists
   - Progress monitoring
   - Notes section

## Choosing a Design Flow

### Use BMad when:
- Building from scratch with AI assistance
- Iterating quickly on features
- Prototyping and exploring ideas
- Working on greenfield projects

### Use Spec Kits when:
- Requirements are well-defined
- Multiple stakeholders need alignment
- Complex system with many integrations
- Documentation is critical

### Use Both when:
- Large project with multiple phases
- Some features need detailed specs, others need exploration
- Team uses different approaches for different components

## Integration with Project Documentation

Your project includes structured documentation:

- **docs/uncle-bob.md** - Ideas and requirements logbook
- **docs/PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document
- **docs/architecture.md** - Technical architecture
- **docs/plan.md** - Implementation plan

Design flows complement these documents by providing:
- Structured methodologies
- Phase-based workflows
- AI collaboration guidelines

## Getting Started

1. Read the GUIDE.md for your chosen design flow(s)
2. Copy TEMPLATE.md content to start your workflow
3. Integrate with existing project docs
4. Follow the methodology as you build

## Tips for Success

- **Stay Consistent**: Follow the chosen methodology
- **Update Regularly**: Keep templates and docs current
- **Adapt as Needed**: Methodologies are guidelines, not rigid rules
- **Leverage AI**: Use AI assistants to help with each phase
